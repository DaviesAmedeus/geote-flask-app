                <p>GeoTE In collaboration with the SMCoSE YouthMappers from Sokoine University of Agriculture, we
                    conducted a plastic waste mapping project in Morogoro Municipality to contribute efforts towards
                    improving waste management and reducing flooding effects caused by the piling of plastic waste in
                    waterways. Over 10,000 datasets were collected, analyzed, and the results disseminated in
                    collaboration with the local government. </p>

                <p>Enthused with improving disaster management and responses, GeoTE conducted a participatory project
                    between local government, community, and affected and interested stakeholders in Morogoro Municipal
                    and Ifakara Town Council, addressing and developing cost-effective ways to improve responses to
                    flooding effects. Data was collected, guideline maps were developed, and new knowledge was developed,
                    contributing to efforts of mitigating flooding effects in project areas.</p>
